# [[Javascript]] package manager:
## 1) You need `package.jason` file in your project:
```[baymax@Baymax ~]$``` ```npm init``` 
## 2) You can install stuff by Locally and Globally:
### Locally:
```[baymax@Baymax ~]$``` ```npm install live-server```
### Globally:
```[baymax@Baymax ~]$``` ```npm install -g live-server```
# 3) As soon as you install something , if its locally, and if we have `package.jason` then the npm will update the `package.jason` file to include whatever new things we installed. 
# 4) Lets say we need to install `lodash` which is an extension for javascript. We will follow whatever their guide tells us to do in order to include their script files. But not all browsers can use it so we will need something called `browserify`.
# 5) `browserify`:
## 5.1) Run:
```[baymax@Baymax ~]$``` ```npm install -g browserify```
```[baymax@Baymax ~]$``` ```browserify script.js > bundle.js```
### Add what ever `.js` file you need. This will create a new file called `bundle.js`.
## 5.2) Now include `bundle.js` into your HTML instead of `script.js`.
